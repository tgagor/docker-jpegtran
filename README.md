This is simple image with jpegtran executable.

I use it for image optimization in some CI/CD pipelines.

You can fetch docker image from:
* [tgagor/jpegtran](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tgagor/jpegtran)
* ghcr.io/tgagor/jpegtran

Beware that image sets `ENTRYPOINT` straight to `jpegtran`.
